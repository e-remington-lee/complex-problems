Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Uber:

Given a linked list of integers, remove all consecutive nodes that sum up to 0.

Example:
Input: 10 -> 5 -> -3 -> -3 -> 1 -> 4 -> -4
Output: 10

The consecutive nodes 5 -> -3 -> -3 -> 1 sums up to 0 so that sequence should be removed. 4 -> -4 also sums up to 0 too so that sequence should also be removed.

Here's a starting point:
'''
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value=value
        self.next=next

    '''
    can be solved by finding prefix sum
    if l1+l2 = l1+l2+...+l5, meaning that l3 + ... + l5 = 0, 
    then l3 + ... + l5 is the consecutive sequence of nodes we want to delete. 
    If it's a array we could just remove numbers from index of l3 to l5. 
    If it's a linked list, we could let l2.next = l5.next, we then need to have two pointers,
    one point to l2 and the other point to l5

    Intuition and Algorithm
    Imagine that you have this Linked list:
    head: [3,4,2,-6, 1,1,5, -6]

    What elements should I remove?
    We will accumulate the values.
    headâ€™ : [3, 7,9,3,4,5,10,4]
    (Like an array), head'[i] = head[i] + head' [i-1]
    If we see repeated elements then we have to deleted as follows.
